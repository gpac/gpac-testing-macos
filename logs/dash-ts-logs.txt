mp42ts <inputs> <destinations> [options]

Inputs:
-src filename[:OPTS]   specifies an input file used for a TS service
                        * currently only supports ISO files and SDP files
                        * can be used several times, once for each program
By default each source is a program in a TS. 
Source options are colon-separated list of options, as follows:
ID=N                   specifies the program ID for this source.
             All sources with the same ID will be added to the same program
name=STR               program name, as used in DVB service description table
provider=STR           provider name, as used in DVB service description table

-prog filename        same as -src filename

Destinations:
Several destinations may be specified as follows, at least one is mandatory
-dst-udp UDP_address:port (multicast or unicast)
-dst-rtp RTP_address:port
-dst-file filename
The following parameters may be specified when -dst-file is used
-segment-dir dir       server local directory to store segments (ends with a '/')
-segment-duration dur  segment duration in seconds
-segment-manifest file m3u8 file basename
-segment-http-prefix p client address for accessing server segments
-segment-number n      number of segments to list in the manifest

Basic options:
-rate R                specifies target rate in kbps of the multiplex (optional)
-real-time             specifies the muxer will work in real-time mode
                        * if not specified, the muxer will generate the TS as quickly as possible
                        * automatically set for SDP or BT input
-pcr-init V            sets initial value V for PCR - if not set, random value is used
-pcr-offset V          offsets all timestamps from PCR by V, in 90kHz. Default value is computed based on input media.
-psi-rate V            sets PSI refresh rate V in ms (default 100ms).
                        * If 0, PSI data is only send once at the beginning or before each IDR when -rap option is set.
                        * This should be set to 0 for DASH streams.
-time n                request the muxer to stop after n ms
-single-au             forces 1 PES = 1 AU (disabled by default)
-multi-au              forces 1 PES = N AU for all streams (disabled by default).
                        By default, audio streams pack N AUs in one PES but video and systems data use 1 AU per PES.
-rap                   forces RAP/IDR to be aligned with PES start for video streams (disabled by default)
                          in this mode, PAT, PMT and PCR will be inserted before the first TS packet of the RAP PES
-flush-rap             same as -rap but flushes all other streams (sends remaining PES packets) before inserting PAT/PMT
-nb-pack N             specifies to pack up to N TS packets together before sending on network or writing to file
-pcr-ms N              sets max interval in ms between 2 PCR. Default is 100 ms or at each PES header
-force-pcr-only        allows sending PCR-only packets to enforce the requested PCR rate - STILL EXPERIMENTAL.
-ttl N                 specifies Time-To-Live for multicast. Default is 1.
-ifce IPIFCE           specifies default IP interface to use. Default is IF_ANY.
-temi [URL]            Inserts TEMI time codes in adaptation field. URL is optional, and can be a number for external timeline IDs
-temi-delay DelayMS    Specifies delay between two TEMI url descriptors (default is 1000)
-temi-offset OffsetMS  Specifies an offset in ms to add to TEMI (by default TEMI starts at 0)
-temi-noloop           Do not restart the TEMI timeline at the end of the source
-temi2 ID              Inserts a secondary TEMI time codes in adaptation field of the audio PID if any. ID shall be set to the desired external timeline IDs
-insert-ntp            Inserts NTP timestamp in TEMI timeline descriptor
-sdt-rate MS           Gives the SDT carrousel rate in milliseconds. If 0 (default), SDT is not sent

MPEG-4/T-DMB options:
-bifs-src filename          update file: must be either an .sdp or a .bt file
-audio url             may be mp3/udp or aac/http (shoutcast/icecast)
-video url             shall be a raw h264 frame
-mpeg4-carousel n      carousel period in ms
-mpeg4 or -4on2        forces usage of MPEG-4 signaling (IOD and SL Config)
-4over2                same as -4on2 and uses PMT to carry OD Updates
-bifs-pes              carries BIFS over PES instead of sections
-bifs-pes-ex           carries BIFS over PES without writing timestamps in SL

Misc options
-mem-track             enables memory tracker
-mem-track-stack       enables memory tracker stack dumping
-logs                  set log tools and levels, formatted as a ':'-separated list of toolX[:toolZ]@levelX
-h or -help            print this screen
